# Book Recommendation System

This project is a book recommendation system that suggests books based on user-selected books from a dataset. It uses machine learning (KNN - Nearest Neighbors) to find similar books based on ratings, language, and other features.

You can interact with the application on Hugging Face Spaces:

## How It Works

1. The user uploads a dataset of books.
2. The system allows the user to select a book from the dataset.
3. Based on the selected book, the system recommends similar books using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle:

## Usage
